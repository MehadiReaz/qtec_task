Architecture
This project implements Clean Architecture principles with three main layers:
Domain Layer

Entities: Core business objects (ProductEntity, ProductListEntity)
Use Cases: Application-specific business rules
Repository Interfaces: Abstract definition of data operations

Data Layer

Repository Implementations: Concrete implementations of domain repositories
Data Sources: Remote and local data providers
Models: Data mapping between domain and data layers

Presentation Layer

BLoC: State management using flutter_bloc
UI: Widgets and screens to display data
Event/State: Clear separation of user interactions and UI states

State Management
The app uses BLoC pattern with the following states:

ProductsInitial: Initial state before any data is loaded
ProductsLoading: State during initial data load
ProductsRefreshing: State during pull-to-refresh
ProductsLoaded: State when products are successfully loaded
ProductsEmpty: State when no products match the search criteria
ProductLoadFailed: State when an error occurs
